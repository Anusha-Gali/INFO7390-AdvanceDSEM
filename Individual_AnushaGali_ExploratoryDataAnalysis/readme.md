# Stock Market Data Analysis: Jupyter Notebook

This Jupyter Notebook (`stock_market_analysis.ipynb`) demonstrates how to explore historical stock market data using Python libraries like **pandas**, **NumPy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**. It walks through essential steps such as data loading, preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, and outlier detection.

## Overview

- **Goal**: Leverage historical stock data to uncover patterns that may inform investment decisions.  
- **Approach**:
  - Load and preprocess data
  - Generate descriptive statistics
  - Visualize distributions and correlations
  - Identify and handle outliers
  - Discuss potential implications and next steps

This notebook complements the formal report written in LaTeX (see `main.tex`), providing the executable code behind the analysis.

## Data Requirements

- **Input Format**: A CSV file (or similar) with columns such as `Date`, `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Close`, `Volume`, etc.  
- **Date Parsing**: Make sure to parse dates (e.g., using `parse_dates=['Date']` in `pandas.read_csv`) so that time-series operations can be applied.

Example of minimal CSV columns:
Date,Symbol,Series,Prev Close,Open,High,Low,Close,Volume 2007-11-27,MUNDRAPORT,EQ,440.00,770.00,1050.00,770.00,962.90,1234567 ...

## Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading**  
   Load the CSV file into a Pandas `DataFrame`, sort by `Date`, and reset the index.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handle missing values (drop or impute).  
   - Filter out unnecessary symbols or data ranges if needed.
   
3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Compute **Daily Returns** (`pct_change` on `Close`).  
   - Calculate **Rolling Volatility** (e.g., 10-day STD of daily returns).  
   - Generate **Moving Averages** (e.g., 50-day, 200-day).
   
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - **Descriptive Stats** (`DataFrame.describe()`).  
   - **Histograms** and **KDE plots** for distribution.  
   - **Correlation Heatmap** and **Pair Plots** for relationships between variables.
   
5. **Outlier Detection**  
   - Identify extreme values (e.g., using Z-scores or IQR).  
   - Optionally remove or cap outliers to reduce skew.
   
6. **Observations and Conclusions**  
   - Summarize findings and interpret potential financial or practical significance.
